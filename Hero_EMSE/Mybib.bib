abstract="Fault prediction by negative binomial regression models is shown to be effective for four large production software systems from industry. A model developed originally with data from systems with regularly scheduled releases was successfully adapted to a system without releases to identify 20{\%} of that system's files that contained 75{\%} of the faults. A model with a pre-specified set of variables derived from earlier research was applied to three additional systems, and proved capable of identifying averages of 81, 94 and 76{\%} of the faults in those systems. A primary focus of this paper is to investigate the impact on predictive accuracy of using data about the number of developers who access individual code units. For each system, including the cumulative number of developers who had previously modified a file yielded no more than a modest improvement in predictive accuracy. We conclude that while many factors can ``spoil the broth'' (lead to the release of software with too many defects), the number of developers is not a major influence.",

abstract="Previous research has provided evidence that a combination of static code metrics and software history metrics can be used to predict with surprising success which files in the next release of a large system will have the largest numbers of defects. In contrast, very little research exists to indicate whether information about individual developers can profitably be used to improve predictions. We investigate whether files in a large system that are modified by an individual developer consistently contain either more or fewer faults than the average of all files in the system. The goal of the investigation is to determine whether information about which particular developer modified a file is able to improve defect predictions. We also extend earlier research evaluating use of counts of the number of developers who modified a file as predictors of the file's future faultiness. We analyze change reports filed for three large systems, each containing 18 releases, with a combined total of nearly 4 million LOC and over 11,000 files. A buggy file ratio is defined for programmers, measuring the proportion of faulty files in Release R out of all files modified by the programmer in Release R-1. We assess the consistency of the buggy file ratio across releases for individual programmers both visually and within the context of a fault prediction model. Buggy file ratios for individual programmers often varied widely across all the releases that they participated in. A prediction model that takes account of the history of faulty files that were changed by individual developers shows improvement over the standard negative binomial model of less than 0.13{\%} according to one measure, and no improvement at all according to another measure. In contrast, augmenting a standard model with counts of cumulative developers changing files in prior releases produced up to a 2{\%} improvement in the percentage of faults detected in the top 20{\%} of predicted faulty files. The cumulative number of developers interacting with a file can be a useful variable for defect prediction. However, the study indicates that adding information to a model about which particular developer modified a file is not likely to improve defect predictions.",

abstract="Software forges like GitHub host millions of repositories. Software engineering researchers have been able to take advantage of such a large corpora of potential study subjects with the help of tools like GHTorrent and Boa. However, the simplicity in querying comes with a caveat: there are limited means of separating the signal (e.g. repositories containing engineered software projects) from the noise (e.g. repositories containing home work assignments). The proportion of noise in a random sample of repositories could skew the study and may lead to researchers reaching unrealistic, potentially inaccurate, conclusions. We argue that it is imperative to have the ability to sieve out the noise in such large repository forges. We propose a framework, and present a reference implementation of the framework as a tool called reaper, to enable researchers to select GitHub repositories that contain evidence of an engineered software project. We identify software engineering practices (called dimensions) and propose means for validating their existence in a GitHub repository. We used reaper to measure the dimensions of 1,857,423 GitHub repositories. We then used manually classified data sets of repositories to train classifiers capable of predicting if a given GitHub repository contains an engineered software project. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a set of 200 repositories with known ground truth classification. We also compared the performance of the classifiers to other approaches to classification (e.g. number of GitHub Stargazers) and found our classifiers to outperform existing approaches. We found stargazers-based classifier (with 10 as the threshold for number of stargazers) to exhibit high precision (97{\%}) but an inversely proportional recall (32{\%}). On the other hand, our best classifier exhibited a high precision (82{\%}) and a high recall (86{\%}). The stargazer-based criteria offers precision but fails to recall a significant portion of the population.",

abstract="Fault prediction by negative binomial regression models is shown to be effective for four large production software systems from industry. A model developed originally with data from systems with regularly scheduled releases was successfully adapted to a system without releases to identify 20{\%} of that system's files that contained 75{\%} of the faults. A model with a pre-specified set of variables derived from earlier research was applied to three additional systems, and proved capable of identifying averages of 81, 94 and 76{\%} of the faults in those systems. A primary focus of this paper is to investigate the impact on predictive accuracy of using data about the number of developers who access individual code units. For each system, including the cumulative number of developers who had previously modified a file yielded no more than a modest improvement in predictive accuracy. We conclude that while many factors can ``spoil the broth'' (lead to the release of software with too many defects), the number of developers is not a major influence.",

abstract = "Context
Software industry has widely adopted Agile software development methods. Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics.
Method
This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process.
Results
The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate.
Conclusion
The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry."

abstract = "Software metrics have been studied in the procedural paradigm as a quantitative means of assessing the software development process as well as the quality of software products. Several studies have validated that various metrics are useful indicators of maintenance effort in the procedural paradigm. However, software metrics have rarely been studied in the object-oriented paradigm. Very few metrics have been proposed to measure object-oriented systems, and the proposed ones have not been validated. This research concentrates on several object-oriented software metrics and the validation of these metrics with maintenance effort in two commercial systems. Statistical analyses of a prediction model incorporating 10 metrics were performed. In addition, a more compact model with fewer metrics is presented."

abstract = "One goal of this paper is to empirically explore the relationships between existing object-oriented (OO) coupling, cohesion, and inheritance measures and the probability of fault detection in system classes during testing. In other words, we wish to better understand the relationship between existing design measurement in OO systems and the quality of the software developed. The second goal is to propose an investigation and analysis strategy to make these kind of studies more repeatable and comparable, a problem which is pervasive in the literature on quality measurement. Results show that many of the measures capture similar dimensions in the data set, thus reflecting the fact that many of them are based on similar principles and hypotheses. However, it is shown that by using a subset of measures, accurate models can be built to predict which classes most of the faults are likely to lie in. When predicting fault-prone classes, the best model shows a percentage of correct classifications higher than 80% and finds more than 90% of faulty classes. Besides the size of classes, the frequency of method invocations and the depth of inheritance hierarchies seem to be the main driving factors of fault-proneness."

This means that if these faulty software components can be detected early in the development project's life cycle, mitigating actions can be taken, such as a redesign. For object-oriented applications, prediction models using design metrics can be used to identify faulty classes early on. In this paper we report on a study that used object-oriented design metrics to construct such prediction models. The study used data collected from one version of a commercial Java application for constructing a prediction model. The model was then validated on a subsequent release of the same application. Our results indicate that the prediction model has a high accuracy. Furthermore, we found that an export coupling (EC) metric had the strongest association with fault-proneness, indicating a structural feature that may be symptomatic of a class with a high probability of latent faults."

Decision support tools for this have been built using causal models represented by Bayesian Networks (BNs), incorporating empirical data and expert judgement. Previously, this required a custom BN for each development lifecycle. We describe a more general approach that allows causal models to be applied to any lifecycle. The approach evolved through collaborative projects and captures significant commercial input. For projects within the range of the models, defect predictions are very accurate. This approach enables decision-makers to reason in a way that is not possible with regression-based models."

abstract="There are lots of different software metrics discovered and used for defect prediction in the literature. Instead of dealing with so many metrics, it would be practical and easy if we could determine the set of metrics that are most important and focus on them more to predict defectiveness. We use Bayesian networks to determine the probabilistic influential relationships among software metrics and defect proneness. In addition to the metrics used in Promise data repository, we define two more metrics, i.e. NOD for the number of developers and LOCQ for the source code quality. We extract these metrics by inspecting the source code repositories of the selected Promise data repository data sets. At the end of our modeling, we learn the marginal defect proneness probability of the whole software system, the set of most effective metrics, and the influential relationships among metrics and defectiveness. Our experiments on nine open source Promise data repository data sets show that response for class (RFC), lines of code (LOC), and lack of coding quality (LOCQ) are the most effective metrics whereas coupling between objects (CBO), weighted method per class (WMC), and lack of cohesion of methods (LCOM) are less effective metrics on defect proneness. Furthermore, number of children (NOC) and depth of inheritance tree (DIT) have very limited effect and are untrustworthy. On the other hand, based on the experiments on Poi, Tomcat, and Xalan data sets, we observe that there is a positive correlation between the number of developers (NOD) and the level of defectiveness. However, further investigation involving a greater number of projects is needed to confirm our findings.",

abstract = "Context
Software defect prediction plays a crucial role in estimating the most defect-prone components of software, and a large number of studies have pursued improving prediction accuracy within a project or across projects. However, the rules for making an appropriate decision between within- and cross-project defect prediction when available historical data are insufficient remain unclear.
Objective
The objective of this work is to validate the feasibility of the predictor built with a simplified metric set for software defect prediction in different scenarios, and to investigate practical guidelines for the choice of training data, classifier and metric subset of a given project.
Method
First, based on six typical classifiers, three types of predictors using the size of software metric set were constructed in three scenarios. Then, we validated the acceptable performance of the predictor based on Top-k metrics in terms of statistical methods. Finally, we attempted to minimize the Top-k metric subset by removing redundant metrics, and we tested the stability of such a minimum metric subset with one-way ANOVA tests.
Results
The study has been conducted on 34 releases of 10 open-source projects available at the PROMISE repository. The findings indicate that the predictors built with either Top-k metrics or the minimum metric subset can provide an acceptable result compared with benchmark predictors. The guideline for choosing a suitable simplified metric set in different scenarios is presented in Table 12.
Conclusion
The experimental results indicate that (1) the choice of training data for defect prediction should depend on the specific requirement of accuracy; (2) the predictor built with a simplified metric set works well and is very useful in case limited resources are supplied; (3) simple classifiers (e.g., Naïve Bayes) also tend to perform well when using a simplified metric set for defect prediction; and (4) in several cases, the minimum metric subset can be identified to facilitate the procedure of general defect prediction with acceptable loss of prediction precision in practice."

abstract="Software code review, i.e., the practice of having other team members critique changes to a software system, is a well-established best practice in both open source and proprietary software domains. Prior work has shown that formal code inspections tend to improve the quality of delivered software. However, the formal code inspection process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process, little is known about the relationship between modern code review practices and long-term software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between post-release defects (a popular proxy for long-term software quality) and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process, and (3) code reviewer expertise, i.e., the level of domain-specific expertise of the code reviewers. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that code review coverage, participation, and expertise share a significant link with software quality. Hence, our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly-reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools.",

abstract="The knowledge about the software metrics which serve as defect indicators is vital for the efficient allocation of resources for quality assurance. It is the process metrics, although sometimes difficult to collect, which have recently become popular with regard to defect prediction. However, in order to identify rightly the process metrics which are actually worth collecting, we need the evidence validating their ability to improve the product metric-based defect prediction models. This paper presents an empirical evaluation in which several process metrics were investigated in order to identify the ones which significantly improve the defect prediction models based on product metrics. Data from a wide range of software projects (both, industrial and open source) were collected. The predictions of the models that use only product metrics (simple models) were compared with the predictions of the models which used product metrics, as well as one of the process metrics under scrutiny (advanced models). To decide whether the improvements were significant or not, statistical tests were performed and effect sizes were calculated. The advanced defect prediction models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally Number of Distinct Committers (NDC) were significantly better than the simple models without NDC, while the effect size was medium and the probability of superiority (PS) of the advanced models over simple ones was high ({\$}{\$}p=.016{\$}{\$}p=.016, {\$}{\$}r=-.29{\$}{\$}r=-.29, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}PS{\}}=.76{\$}{\$}PS=.76), which is a substantial finding useful in defect prediction. A similar result with slightly smaller PS was achieved by the advanced models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally all of the investigated process metrics ({\$}{\$}p=.038{\$}{\$}p=.038, {\$}{\$}r=-.29{\$}{\$}r=-.29, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}PS{\}}=.68{\$}{\$}PS=.68). The advanced models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally Number of Modified Lines (NML) were significantly better than the simple models without NML, but the effect size was small ({\$}{\$}p=.038{\$}{\$}p=.038, {\$}{\$}r=.06{\$}{\$}r=.06). Hence, it is reasonable to recommend the NDC process metric in building the defect prediction models.",

abstract="An estimation of software defects can be obtained in the later phase of software testing. However, with the aim of cost-effectiveness and timely management of resources, the software defects estimation in the early phases of software development life cycle (SDLC) is one of the major research areas. In this paper, a software defect estimation model is proposed using Bayesian belief network (BBN) and reliability relevant metrics of early phases of SDLC (e.g., requirement analysis, design and coding phases). The causal relationship of software metrics is modeled using BBN. The qualitative value of software metrics and expert assessment of software defects is used for developing the proposed model. The defects estimation accuracy of the proposed model is examined using qualitative data set of ten real software projects. The defects estimation results are compared with the existing model and found more accurate.",

abstract="Software quality is the fundamental requirement for a user, academia person, software developing organizations and researchers. In this paper a model for object-oriented Software Bug Prediction System (SBPS) has been developed. This model is capable of predicting the existence of bugs in a class if found, during software validation using metrics. The designed model forecasts the occurrences of bugs in a class when any new system is tested on it. For this experiment some open source similar types of defect datasets (projects) have been collected from Promise Software Engineering Repository. Some of these datasets have been selected for prediction of bugs, of which a few are not involved in model construction. First of all, we have formulated some hypotheses corresponding to each and every metric, and from metrics validation based on hypothesis basis finally 14 best suitable metrics have been selected for model creation. The Logistic Regression Classifier provides good accuracy among all classifiers. The proposed model is trained and tested on each of the validated dataset, including validated Combined Dataset separately too. The performance measure (accuracy) is computed in each case and finally it is found that the model provides overall averaged accuracy of 76.27{\%}.",

abstract="Software industries strive for software quality improvement by consistent bug prediction, bug removal and prediction of fault-prone module. This area has attracted researchers due to its significant involvement in software industries. Various techniques have been presented for software defect prediction. Recent researches have recommended data-mining using machine learning as an important paradigm for software bug prediction. state-of-art software defect prediction task suffer from various issues such as classification accuracy. However, software defect datasets are imbalanced in nature and known fault prone due to its huge dimension. To address this issue, here we present a combined approach for software defect prediction and prediction of software bugs. Proposed approach delivers a concept of feature reduction and artificial intelligence where feature reduction is carried out by well-known principle component analysis (PCA) scheme which is further improved by incorporating maximum-likelihood estimation for error reduction in PCA data reconstruction. Finally, neural network based classification technique is applied which shows prediction results. A framework is formulated and implemented on NASA software dataset where four datasets i.e., KC1, PC3, PC4 and JM1 are considered for performance analysis using MATLAB simulation tool. An extensive experimental study is performed where confusion, precision, recall, classification accuracy etc. parameters are computed and compared with existing software defect prediction techniques. Experimental study shows that proposed approach can provide better performance for software defect prediction.",

abstract="Context Applications of software have penetrated into every part of human life and have become significant in versatile areas. A case of negligence could cost a great loss of economy or even to life (Pentium FDIV bug ``Statistical Analysis of Floating Point Flaw: Intel White Paper'' (PDF) (2004) [1]; The Helminthiasis of the Internet [2]), and hence the reliability of the functions of an application is of extreme importance. A software error could be a deviation from the process flow, improper requirement definitions, or ambiguity in defining the constraints (IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology (1990) [3]). To avoid the lateral effects, the applications should be evaluated beforehand for all defects in all phases of the software cycle. Objective This paper emphasizes on the prediction of software defect density using weighted neural networks and comparison with the fuzzy logic-based approach. Method Each design phase is divided into the neural network node. Software metrics are chosen for each stage and fed into the nodes with a weight associated to it. Neural network system are associated with input layers, SW-DDC layer (stage-wise defect density calculation layer) and C-DDC (consolidated defect density calculation layer). Results The accuracy of the predicted defects is very close the actual defects. Validation results show this method is very accurate than the current methods like fuzzy implementation. Conclusion Weighted artificial networks is used to predict the software defect density and is been verified on different real-time data sets ranging from very low project sizes to the very high project size.",
